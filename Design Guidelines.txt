| Status Frame - ProgressBar, text progress, next button|
|_______________________________________________________|

Each Frame shall have the following method, like an abstract class:

create(*args) -> void       Called when the frame is to be created and displayed
validate(*args) -> bool     Called when information has changed, or when the frame needs to be updated
invoke(*args) -> void       Called when a UI element has been invoked, such as a button

For the GUI, there should be one individual frame for each step of the installation process, in an effort to preserve
simplicity and ease of access.

There shall be seven steps to the installation process:

1. Welcome Screen

Here, the user shall be welcomed, and guided into the UI of the installer program.

2. Overview of Installation

Here, the user shall be informed of the program that they about to install, as well as the amount of space it will take on
their hard drive. It will also outline the steps that will be taken in order for the program to be successfully installed.

3. Overview of licenses/End User License Agreement

Here, the user will be asked to confirm that they will follow the license/End User License Agreement. The continuation of the
program will rely on the acceptance of the user agreement. The agreement shall be loaded from a file, contained within the
application.

4. Installation Path Configuration

Here, the user will be asked to select a path to install the application. A File Dialog option will be provided for ease of
use.

5. Installation

Here, progress will be shown concerning the installation, as well as an estimation of time remaining to complete the
installation. A progressbar will be shown. At this frame, no user input shall be made. At this moment, the extraction of
files and unpackaging, and movement shall take place.

6. Summary

Here, the user will be shown as summary report of the installation of the program, and whether it was successful. They will
also be asked whether they would like to have a shortcut to the application to be placed on their desktop.

7. Program Exit

Self-explanatory: The program shall exit normally. Pretty simple right?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any variable data shall be listed in the Resources.py file, for indexing. The license agreement to be accepted by the end user shall be located in a file called agreement.txt, with utf-8 encoding.
